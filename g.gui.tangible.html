<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
Tangible Landscape is a collaborative modeling environment for
analysis of terrain changes which couples a scanner, projector
and a physical 3D model with GRASS GIS.

<p>The software consists of a plugin for GRASS GIS and addon
<a href="https://github.com/ncsu-osgeorel/r.in.kinect">r.in.kinect</a>
for Kinect for Windows.

<h3>Scanning and analyses controls</h3>
Upper row of buttons controls calibration and scanning mode:
<dl>
  <dt>Start</dt>
  <dd>Start continuous scanning and analyses</dd>
  <dt>Stop</dt>
  <dd>Stop continuous scanning and analyses</dd>
  <dt>Calibrate</dt>
  <dd>Scan and save calibration data, no analyses computed.</dd>
  <dt>Scan once</dt>
  <dd>Scan only once and then run analyses</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Calibration</h4>
Calibration is a simple process ensuring the resulting scan is
horizontal (not tiled). This can happen when the scanner
is not aligned perfectly vertically.
Calibration is performed by scanning (by pressing <i>Calibrate</i> button)
an empty table before placing the model on the table.
The calibration parameters are saved into GUI settings file in GRASS home folder
and applied during scanning to compensate for the misalignment.

<h4>Scanning options</h4>
Scanning tab consists of several input fields influencing
the georeferencing and quality of the resulting scanned raster.
Most of these options are directly input into
<a href="https://github.com/ncsu-osgeorel/r.in.kinect">r.in.kinect</a>
module:
<dl>
  <dt>Name of scanned raster</dt>
  <dd>Name of the raster derived from scanning</dd>
  <dt>Reference DEM</dt>
  <dd>Name of the reference DEM from which georeferencing information is taken.
  The scanned raster will have the same extent.</dd>
  <dt>Reference region</dt>
  <dd>Name of the reference region file from which georeferencing information is taken.
  The scanned raster will have the same extent.</dd>
  <dt>Z-exaggeration</dt>
  <dd>Specify the vertical exaggeration of the physical model
  to scale the digital model correctly to real world dimensions</dd>
  <dt>Number of scans</dt>
  <dd>Number of scans to integrate.
  More scans will result in slower scanning intervals,
  but reduced gaps in the resulting scanned raster.</dd>
  <dt>Rotation angle</dt>
  <dd>Rotate scan along Z axis in degrees counterclockwise</dd>
  <dt>Smooth value</dt>
  <dd>Set smoothing radius (in mm) of
  <a href="http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/resampling.php#moving-least-squares">
  Moving Least Squares (MLS) surface reconstruction method</a></dd>
  <dt>Resolution</dt>
  <dd>Resolution of the scanned raster in mm</dd>
  <dt>Limit scan vertically</dt>
  <dd>Specify minimum and maximum distance from the scanner in cm,
  points outside of that limit are filtered</dd>
  <dt>Trim scan</dt>
  <dd>Specify horizontal distance in cm from the center of the scanner
  in N, S, E and W directions to limit scanned area</dd>
  <dt>Trim tolerance</dt>
  <dd>If specified, use automatic horizontal trimming to avoid hands and other
  objects lying around the model. Higher values close to 1 result in more aggressive
  trimming. Recommended only for rectangular models.</dd>
  <dt>Use interpolation instead of binning</dt>
  <dd>Interpolation can fill gaps in the raster, however it takes more time.
  Binning is fast but can leave some gaps in case of insufficient point cloud coverage.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Analyses</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Analyses file</dt>
<dd>Path to a Python file with analyses
to be run whenever a new scanned raster is processed.
This files contains defined functions performing different geospatial tasks.
All functions starting with <tt>run_</tt> are launched, other ones are ignored.
GRASS GIS modules are called and chained in these functions using
<a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/grass71/manuals/libpython/index.html">
GRASS Python Scripting API</a>.
This file is re-imported in every loop, so saved changes are applied
for new loop. In case of error (for example syntax error), the file
is ignored until the error is fixed.</dd>
<dt>Create new file</dt>
<dd>Creates a new analyses file in user defined location
with pre-defined analyses which need to be uncommented if they are to be used.
This file can then be edited and
more analyses can be added.</dd>
</dl>

All settings are saved when the dialog is closed to GRASS home folder and are used
when re-opening the dialog.
